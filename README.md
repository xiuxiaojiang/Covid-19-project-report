# Covid-19-project-report

The COVID-19 virus has evolved into several variants including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron over the past two years. Delta and Omicron were named Variants of concern by organizations like the CDC. Despite vaccinations and mask-wearing, infections became more common with Omicron, but the infections were mild in most people. The primary concern is the death rate, and the project aims to investigate if there is a difference in death rates between Delta and Omicron and if vaccination rates affect the death rates of these variants.

Model: two-way ANOVA 
Results: Delta is more deadly than Omicron. There is no effect of variants that depend on vaccination rate/level.
